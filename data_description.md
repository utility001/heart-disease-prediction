# Heart Disease classification - Data Description

The goal is to detrmine whether a patient has heart disease or not based on avialable data

Objective:
    Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
    Build classification models to predict whether or not the patients have Heart Disease.
    Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
